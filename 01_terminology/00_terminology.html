<h3>Terminology and symbols</h3>
<p>
    Coins in this system are called &ldquo;nyzo&rdquo; (plural &ldquo;nyzos&rdquo;). The prefix for a nyzo is the
    mathematical intersection symbol, &cap;. So, &ldquo;5 nyzos&rdquo; would be written as &ldquo;&cap;5.&rdquo; The
    smallest unit of measurement is the micronyzo. A micronyzo is 1/1,000,000 of a nyzo. The prefix for a micronyzo is
    the lowercase Greek letter mu, &micro;. So, &ldquo;15 micronyzos&rdquo; would be written as &micro;15. To avoid
    ambiguity and to eliminate rounding issues, all transactions are handled at the programmatic and blockchain levels
    in terms of micronyzos, and fractional micronyzos cannot be specified anywhere in the system.

<p>
    Several &ldquo;edges&rdquo; are discussed in this system. The &ldquo;frozen edge&rdquo; is the highest block that a
    verifier has agreed it will never change, and the consensus mechanism is built to extend the frozen edge as quickly
    as possible while ensuring that no two verifiers acting in good faith ever freeze different blocks at the same
    level. The &ldquo;trailing edge&rdquo; is the lowest block that was necessary to determine the state of the frozen
    edge, and the &ldquo;retention edge&rdquo; is the lowest block for which a verifier will service normal requests.
    The frozen edge and trailing edge are precisely defined based on characteristics of the blockchain, while
    the retention edge is an arbitrary buffer behind the trailing edge that is useful in bootstrapping new
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    Specifically, the trailing edge is defined as the last 4 cycleâ€™s (4N) plus one block (thus, the current trailing edge 
    is approximately *frozen edge - 4N - 1*, where "N" is the cycle size). The retention edge is set 24 blocks before this
    (R = T - 24). Block file consolidation is performed on blocks (R - 1000) to R periodically to reduce the size of the 
    data required by about 99%.
